# Brace Health Engineering: Healthcare Billing Life-Cycle Simulation

---

## Introduction

Weâ€™re excited to see how you tackle this exercise to get a sense of your:

- **A. Ability to learn (slope)**
- **B. Grit (slope-derivative)**
- **C. Computer science knowledge (y intercept)**
- **D. Product sense** (is this even the right graph?)
- **E. Communication skills** (do you make pretty plotlines? idk perhaps Iâ€™m pushing this metaphor a bit far)

We will review your solution in a live follow-up conversation. Our objective is to have an insightful technical discussion around your code, your reasoning, and the design choices youâ€™ve made.

> **Note:** There is no specific deadline; reach out to schedule your follow up when you are ready. We expect you to use all resources available to you, just like if we were to work together. You can and should use AI codegen as you deem appropriate. A submission with deliverables that clearly go above and beyond will score highly on B) and likely the other components of our rubric. A game-winner will do so with a faster turnaround time than you would have considered possible 12 or 24 months ago.

## Project

The goal of this project is to assess your ability to design, implement, test, and reason about a system that simulates the healthcare billing life-cycle. You will write a program that implements a real-time simulation facilitating the interactions between a billing service, a healthcare clearinghouse, and insurance payers.

Along the way, please be prepared to discuss broader software engineering topics such as:

- concurrency/parallelism
- performance tradeoffs
- system design
- testing
- monitoring
- usability
- real-world constraints

Your solution should be **efficient, complete, and correct**. It should use all the resources available to the machine as best as it can.

## Why this matters

Our mission is to ensure that patients receive the insurance dollars they deserve and that providers get paid for the care they deliver. This requires a critical set of capabilities â€” from understanding what the patientâ€™s insurance will cover, to providing cost estimates to the patient upfront, to fighting wrongful claim denials. Each depends on fast, accurate, and reliable â€˜negotiationsâ€™ with healthcare clearinghouses and insurance payers. The better our infrastructure for executing these negotiations, the greater impact we can make on patients and providers alike. Onward.

## Your Task

You may use any programming language you would like and you may use any resources available to you, including AI ðŸ§ . The goal is to demonstrate your ability to write complete, correct, maintainable, and performant software systems. **Bonus points** for writing memory-safe, parallelizeable, and concurrent software that can fully utilize the underlying hardware.

### 1. Ingest the claims from the input file with a configurable rate (e.g. 1 claim per second)

- Your program must accept a single command line argument that points to the input file. The file will be plaintext and will contain exactly one JSON object per line. Each object will strictly adhere to the PayerClaim JSON Schema linked below. The file may be arbitrarily long or short.

### 2. Submit the claim to the payer via a simulated clearinghouse

- After ingesting the claim, the billing company will send the claim to the payer via a healthcare clearinghouse.
- You must implement this clearinghouse yourself. Its job is to receive claim documents from the biller then forward them to the relevant insurance payer as determined by the `payer_id`.

### 3. Forward the claim to the payer and back to the claim submitter (billing company/practice)

- The clearinghouse is responsible for receiving the claims from the practitioner and forwarding them to the correct payer.

### 4. Adjudicate the insurance payer decision

- Payers receive the payer claim documents from clearinghouses, determine how much they will pay, assign patient responsibility as needed, and respond with a payer remittance advice document to the clearinghouse. In the real-world, they use a document called EDI 835.
- You must define the payer remittance advice object (you can research EDI 835 for inspiration). It must be capable of assigning a `payer_paid_amount`, `coinsurance_amount`, `copay_amount`, `deductible_amount`, and `not_allowed_amount` for each service line in each claim. The sum of the 4 must equal the billed amounts in the payer claim.
- You can decide how you want to arbitrate the payment values.
- The time that it takes for each payer to respond should be randomly generated from a distribution bounded by the payer's `min_response_time_secs` and `max_response_time_secs` parameters.

### 5. Forward the remittance response back to the original submitter

- The clearinghouse is responsible for receiving the remittance from the payer and forwarding it to the original submitter.

### 6. Interpret the remittance data to compute the following statistics. Both sets of stats should be printed to the console every 5 seconds so we can follow along.

- **An AR (Accounts Receivable) aging report by payer.**
  - We recommend you spend a few minutes with ChatGPT/Claude to learn more about how an AR Aging report works and why providers care about it.
  - The report should be bucketed into:
    - 0-1 minutes
    - 1-2 minutes
    - 2-3 minutes
    - 3+ minutes
- **Summary statistics for the copay, coinsurance, and deductible per patient.**

### 7. Testing

- Your program should be testable and you should demonstrate how. We wonâ€™t be looking for 100% coverage, just good fundamentals.

### 8. Monitoring

- Your program should emit what it needs to such that we can diagnose and understand its behavior at runtime.

### 9. Shutdown

- After all claims have been fully processed and their final stats have been serialized to the terminal, the program should gracefully shutdown.

## Deliverables

1. **ZIP File via email**
    - Source code
    - Tests
2. **Live discussion:** In addition to the coding portion, be prepared to share your thoughts on:
    - How do you incorporate feedback loops into your system and iterate quickly?
    - Where do you see the most important tradeoffs in your design?

---

## Closing

1. **Be creative:** Feel free to go beyond the requirements.
2. **We value readability & simplicity:** Well-abstracted, logical, documented code is a requirement. Have compassion for the users of your code (aka us).
3. **Weâ€™ll discuss:** Weâ€™re not just looking at the final result but also at how you communicate and reason about design, tradeoffs, performance, and maintainability.
4. **Keep the infra simple & stick to a single machine:** Write software that runs in a single process. Avoid complicated external tools/systems e.g. the kafkaâ€™s of the world. No need for network calls. You donâ€™t need to use docker unless you want to, etc. Build the thing yourself!
