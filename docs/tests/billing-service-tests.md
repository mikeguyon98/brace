# Billing Service Test Documentation

## Overview
The Billing Service orchestrates remittance processing, statistics collection, and reporting. It contains critical business logic for financial calculations and claim processing.

## Functions to Test

### 1. BillingStatisticsManager.processRemittance()
**Location**: `src/services/billing/statistics.ts:27-73`

**Purpose**: Process remittance and update billing statistics with financial calculations

**Business Logic**:
- Calculate claim billed, paid, and patient responsibility amounts
- Update aggregate statistics (totals, payer breakdowns)
- Track processing times and maintain memory limits
- Generate patient cost share records

**Test Cases**:

#### Unit Tests
1. **Valid Single Remittance Processing**
   - Input: Standard remittance with multiple lines
   - Expected: Correct sum calculations for billed/paid/patient amounts
   - Verify: Statistics totals updated correctly

2. **Empty Remittance Lines**
   - Input: Remittance with empty remittance_lines array
   - Expected: Zero amounts, stats incremented by 1 claim
   - Verify: No calculation errors

3. **Large Monetary Values**
   - Input: Remittance with very large dollar amounts (>$1M)
   - Expected: Accurate calculations without precision loss
   - Verify: No floating point rounding errors

4. **Patient Responsibility Calculation**
   - Input: Lines with coinsurance, copay, and deductible
   - Expected: Correct sum of all three components
   - Verify: Patient cost share record created

5. **Processing Time Memory Management**
   - Input: Process 1001+ remittances to trigger array truncation
   - Expected: Array maintained at 1000 items max
   - Verify: Memory usage doesn't grow unbounded

6. **Payer Breakdown Updates**
   - Input: Multiple remittances from same payer
   - Expected: Cumulative totals for payer
   - Verify: Payer-specific statistics accuracy

#### Edge Cases
1. **Zero Dollar Claims**
   - Input: All amounts are $0.00
   - Expected: Proper handling without division by zero

2. **Negative Amounts** (Adjustments)
   - Input: Negative paid amounts (refunds/adjustments)
   - Expected: Correct calculation and statistics update

3. **Missing Patient ID Generation**
   - Input: Very short correlation IDs
   - Expected: Graceful patient ID generation

4. **Concurrent Processing**
   - Input: Multiple remittances processed simultaneously
   - Expected: Thread-safe statistics updates

### 2. BillingStatisticsManager.updatePayerBreakdown()
**Location**: `src/services/billing/statistics.ts:78-89`

**Purpose**: Update payer-specific billing statistics

**Test Cases**:
1. **New Payer Registration**
   - Input: First claim for unknown payer
   - Expected: New payer entry created with correct initial values

2. **Existing Payer Updates**
   - Input: Additional claims for known payer
   - Expected: Cumulative totals updated correctly

3. **Multiple Payers Isolation**
   - Input: Claims for different payers
   - Expected: Statistics kept separate per payer

### 3. BillingReportGenerator.generateSummary()
**Location**: `src/services/billing/reporting.ts` (estimated)

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive billing summary reports

**Test Cases**:
1. **Standard Summary Generation**
   - Input: Statistics with multiple payers and claims
   - Expected: Accurate summary with totals and breakdowns

2. **Empty Statistics**
   - Input: No claims processed
   - Expected: Zero values, no division by zero errors

3. **Single Payer vs Multi-Payer**
   - Input: Statistics with 1 vs 5+ payers
   - Expected: Correct payer breakdown calculations

## Integration Tests

### 1. End-to-End Remittance Processing
**Scenario**: Complete remittance flow from queue to statistics
- Setup: Mock remittance queue with test data
- Execute: Process multiple remittances
- Verify: Final statistics match expected calculations

### 2. AR Aging Integration
**Scenario**: Billing service notifies AR aging of claim completion
- Setup: Mock AR aging service
- Execute: Process remittances
- Verify: AR aging service called with correct parameters

### 3. Reporting Integration
**Scenario**: Periodic reporting generation
- Setup: Configure short reporting interval
- Execute: Process claims over time
- Verify: Reports generated at correct intervals

## Performance Tests

### 1. High Volume Processing**
- Input: 10,000+ remittances
- Expected: Processing within memory limits
- Verify: No performance degradation

### 2. Concurrent Access**
- Input: Multiple threads processing remittances
- Expected: Thread-safe operations
- Verify: Accurate final statistics

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample Remittance Messages
```json
{
  "correlation_id": "test-12345",
  "remittance": {
    "payer_id": "PAYER001",
    "remittance_lines": [
      {
        "billed_amount": 150.00,
        "payer_paid_amount": 120.00,
        "coinsurance_amount": 15.00,
        "copay_amount": 10.00,
        "deductible_amount": 5.00
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Edge Case Data
- Zero amount claims
- Negative adjustments
- Very large amounts
- Empty arrays
- Missing fields

## Mock Requirements
- InMemoryQueue for remittance processing
- ARAgingService for completion notifications
- Timer mocks for reporting intervals
- Logger mocks for output verification
